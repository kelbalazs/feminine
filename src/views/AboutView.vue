       A very warm welcome, my name is Orsi and I am the teacher behind Feminine to Thrive.
I've qualified as a yoga teacher back in 2017 but pretty quickly I turned my focus onto helping women and providing space for those big milestones a woman might go through in their life. <br>
<br>
First I became a pregnancy yoga teacher as I found that in that vulnerable time, a woman needs the most support - regular encouragement to trust her capable body, a dedicated time to spend connecting with her new baby, gentle movement to nourish the body and a space, a community that can hold those sometimes heavy yet other times overflowingly joyful emotions.<br> Pregnancy yoga however goes beyond the Mother, because if a baby learns already in the womb to prioritise self-care, if that sense of awareness and mindset to sustain our health and energy is ingrained from a very early age, I have faith that we can raise healthier children and overall help the World heal and become more mindful and loving.<br> 

<br>Later I turned my focus onto fertility yoga - not only because I believe that it is a very isolating time for women to experience challenges with conception and an accepting platform can be vital during that time but also because I've been going through those very same challenges and beyond searching for answers, I so craved connection with women going through something similar. To hold space, to encourage, to melt-down, but then to stand back up together. 

<br>So Feminine to Thrive is a platform where you can come just as you are - with your head held high, or with your heart being heavy, a space where you can move, breathe, experience life just a little bit easier. 

I'm glad that you're here, I'm sure you'll find something valuable for yourself.
