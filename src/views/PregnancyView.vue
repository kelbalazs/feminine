            Pregnancy yoga is a very special practice, because it goes way beyond the Mother. Although our main focus is on maintaining mobility, easing discomfort and most importantly preparing the body for an empowered birth, I also find that most women don't come to a prenatal yoga class because of themselves - unless they already have an established, dedicated yoga practice they would like to keep - but they come because of their Babies. There is a sense of selflessness and care behind the whole intention of the practice that makes it a little bit more magical. 
The practice may also go beyond your mat is, because if a baby learns already in the womb to prioritise self-care, if that sense of awareness and mindset to sustain our health and energy is ingrained from a very early age, I have faith that we can raise healthier children and overall help the World heal and become more mindful and loving. 

From my heart to yours, I`m looking forward to seeing you all on the mat.<br><br><br>
